# Markdown Previewer
## FreeCodeCamp Front End project #2.

As its name suggests, this app will render GitHub flavored markdown into HTML.

User stories (as per [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) fulfilled are: 
- [x] I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
- [x] I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
- [x] When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
- [x] When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type.
- [x]  When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: 
- a header (H1 size)
- a sub header (H2 size) 
- a link 
- inline code
- a code block
- a list item
- a blockquote
- an image
- bolded text.
- [x]  When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.

The React app is hosted on [Github pages](https://charaekeow.github.io/markdownPreviewer/).

### The code?
It's kinda messy right now as I use `react deploy` so I will "refactor" it later so that it is easier to view and maintain.
